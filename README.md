# BlissLauncher3

**BlissLauncher3** is a modified version of the AOSP [Launcher3](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher3), with features inspired from [BlissLauncher v1](https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/BlissLauncher/-/tree/master).

It is the default launcher for [/e/ OS](https://e.foundation/e-os/).

## Building

- Clone the repository

  ```git
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/BlissLauncher3 -b v1-s BlissLauncher3s
  ```

- To build this project, we need the following jars inside the `prebuilts` folder from our AOSP build directory:

  - **framework-13.jar**: `out/soong/.intermediates/frameworks/base/framework/android_common/turbine-combined/framework.jar`

  - We need to build the `Launcher3QuickStepLib` module using `m Launcher3QuickStepLib` and then copy the jar from the following directory:

    - **classes.jar**: `out/target/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/Launcher3QuickStepLib_intermediates/classes.jar`

- Now we need to run two tasks to generate the proper jars:

  ```bash
  # Unzip the classes.jar file
  ./gradlew unzipJar

  # Generate the final jar for Quickstep
  ./gradlew makeReleaseJar
  ```

- Launch Android Studio and Import the project

- Build the project through the IDE or run the following command:

  ```bash
  ./gradlew assembleBlissWithQuickstepDebug
  ```

## Installing

- Below conditions are required to install the app:

  - User should be on **Android 13** /e/OS or LineageOS
  - Rom should be signed with **test keys**

- Download and install the APK like any other normal app from the [pipeline](https://gitlab.e.foundation/e/os/BlissLauncher/-/pipelines/latest?ref=1021-launcher3-rewrite)

- Download and install the icon mask like normal app [SquircleMask.apk](https://gitlab.e.foundation/internal/wiki/-/wikis/uploads/320461a58f097993b29772abe0d2b0b9/KGLN4.apk)

- Go to _Settings > Apps > Default apps > Launcher_ and change launcher to `Blisslauncher` (with green icon)

- It will open a page about `Usage access`. Allow the new BlissLauncher (`Permit usage access`)

- Go to Settings > Display > Icon Shape > Select **Squircle**

- Clear the data of Blisslauncher3 manually through settings or run the command through adb:

  ```bash
  adb shell pm clear com.android.launcher3
  ```

- Reboot

- Now it is totally ready to use and play around with!

## Recurrent task
### Publish a new release for update through app lounge
For this, you need to create a protected tag
which follow this format: `v1.2.3-s`, `v1.2.3-t`

The Android letter is important to let app lounge know which release to use!

also note, that tag with `v*` format will all be protected.


### When a new android version is supported
#### Update .gitlab-ci.yml
When a new Android version is supported, we need to add the gitlab-ci's job that make release to update it through app lounge

1. Add Ci variables:
```
  APK_PATH: "build/outputs/apk/blissWithQuickstep/release"
  UNSIGNED_APK: "BlissLauncher-apiT-release.apk"
  COMMUNITY_APK: "BlissLauncher-apiT-community.apk"
  OFFICIAL_APK: "BlissLauncher-apiT-official.apk.apk"
``` 
but you need to adapt the letter after the api work for `UNSIGNED_APK`, `COMMUNITY_APK`, `OFFICIAL_APK`.

2. Add stage `gitlab_release` in `stages` entry

3. Copy paste jobs from one of a branch for a supported Android version : `init_submodules`, `generate-apks`, `create-json-files` and `create-release`
